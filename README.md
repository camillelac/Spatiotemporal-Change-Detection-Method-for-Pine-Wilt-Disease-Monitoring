## Pine Wilt Disease
Pine wilt disease, also known as pine wilt nematode disease, is a devastating disease that affects pine trees. This disease is caused by a microscopic nematode known as the pine wood nematode, scientifically named Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Pine wilt disease has a profound impact on forestry and ecosystems, causing significant tree mortality and economic losses.
The microscopic roundworm (pine wood nematode) infests the resin canals and tracheids of pine trees. The nematodes disrupt the tree's ability to transport water and essential nutrients, ultimately leading to the death of the tree. The nematodes are transmitted to healthy trees by pine sawyer beetles (Monochamus spp.), which serve as vectors for the disease. These beetles lay their eggs in dead or weakened pine trees. When the larvae hatch, they carry the nematodes with them. Once mature, the adult beetles emerge and can transfer the nematodes to healthy trees as they feed on their resin. Human activities, such as the movement of infected wood or live trees, can also contribute to the disease's spread, especially in international trade and forest management practices.
The symptoms of pine wilt disease can be subtle in the early stages but become more pronounced as the disease progresses. Some of the symptoms are needle discoloration (yellow, then brown, before falling off), wilting branches, resin bleeding (from cracks in the bark), and dead crowns (starting from the top). This disease takes over extremely fast leading to the tree death in just a few months or even weeks.
Pine wilt disease is a global problem, particularly affecting countries like Japan, South Korea, China, and Portugal, where it has caused significant damage to pine forests. This is why the monitoring of this disease is important. Preserving the health of pine forests is essential for maintaining biodiversity and supporting the industries that rely on these valuable trees.

## Single-Date Image Classification

Nowadays, the widely used detection method to spot pine-wilt-infected trees is the single-date image classification method. Single-date image classification is an innovative technology used for the early detection of pine wilt disease in forested regions. It offers a non-invasive and efficient way to assess tree health and pinpoint infected trees.
This method involves the use of remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or drone-based imagery, to capture high-resolution images of forested areas. These images are then processed using advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques. The process typically follows these steps:
•	Data Collection: High-resolution images at different wavelengths (red, blue, green and near infrared) are collected from the target area using satellite or drone sensors. These images provide valuable information about the condition and health of the pine trees.
•	Image Preprocessing: The collected images are preprocessed to remove noise, correct for atmospheric effects, and enhance the features relevant to pine wilt disease detection.
•	Index Computation: An index describing the greenness of the canopy is computed using values of pixels from images from the red and green canals and generates another image.
•	Classification: A machine learning algorithm (often SVM or neural network) classifies each pixel of the image into infected pine tree or non-infected pine tree.
•	Mapping and Visualization: The results are used to create maps or visualizations that show the distribution of healthy and infected trees in the target area.
This method is useful for early detection of the disease by identifying infected trees at an early stage, forest managers and authorities can take proactive measures to mitigate its spread. However, it has some limitations. Many studies have proven the efficiency of this method on pure pine tree forests. For mixed forest, this method’s efficiency decreases dramatically because the seasonal variations of greenness of deciduous trees are often misclassified as infected pine trees. Moreover, under complex landscapes, the sparse vegetation can also lead to false detections. This method results in a lot of false positives (trees classified as infected but are not) under those conditions.
The spatiotemporal change detection method solves some of the problems. By using the difference of canopy greenness between one year and the next and a spatial enhancement, we can spot newly infected trees and avoid false positives due to deciduous trees and soil or human noise.
